# MyDemo.Web
This is a Demo Web Application where users can enter a list of movies, people who are part of those movies and what part they played in those movies.

The project demonstrates the following areas:
* Razor pages with .NET core 3.1
* Command Query Responsibility Separation (CQRS)
* Using In-Memory and DB (coming soon) services to enable testing more easily

Some additional features that will be coming soon are (not an ordered list):
* Using Application Insights
* Sending custom metrics data to Azure Monitor
* Azure AD B2C Authentication and Authorization scenarios
* Command Query services implemented as pure APIs and hosted in their own App Services
* Services hosted in AKS (instead of App Services)
